Plan-it, a responsive web app is a one stop shop for planning a day or night out. The user can login, look up events by location, keyword and category and then save any events that interest them. Based on the location of the event, the user is offered a choice out of three randomly selected restaurants. Once their event and restaurant are saved, the user has the option to email the details to a friend.
